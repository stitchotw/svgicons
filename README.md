# svgicons

Simple [SVG icon editor](https://stitchotw.github.io/svgicons/) written mostly as an exercise in JS, HTML and CSS, and intended to be used to create the icons for [Stitch](https://github.com/stitchotw/stitch). The code is in need of a complete rewrite, and settings and help material is missing, but most of the functionality is in place.
